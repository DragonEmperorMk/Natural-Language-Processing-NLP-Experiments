Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics concerned with giving computers the ability to understand, interpret, and manipulate human language [1: https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/nlp/, 4: https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/artificial-intelligence-tutorial/what-is-natural-language-processing-nlp, 6: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/natural-language-processing-overview/].

Here are some of the core functionalities of NLP:

Understanding the meaning of text: This involves tasks like sentiment analysis, which determines the emotional tone of a piece of writing, and recognizing the intent behind a question or statement [2: https://towardsdatascience.com/basic-concepts-of-natural-language-processing-nlp-models-and-python-implementation-88a589ce1fc0, 3: https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/natural-language-processing-NLP].
Generating human-like text: This can be used for tasks like machine translation, which allows computers to translate text from one language to another, and chatbots, which can hold conversations with humans [5: https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing].
NLP is a rapidly evolving field with a wide range of applications,  from  spam detection and social media analysis  to  machine translation and virtual assistants.
